# Signal-Generator

This project was done in the Computer Aided Design class, and requires knowledge in the field of simulation and modeling of electronic circuits.
The project involves the design of a rectangular/triangular signal generator, using the specifications below and is made in OrCAD Capture CIS Lite program.
Also, after developing the circuit, we created a comprehensive documentation with theoretical support, circuit block diagram, electrical diagram and circuit sizing calculations.
Furthermore, it features 4 simulation profiles namely: transient analysis, spectral and distortion analysis, parametric and optimization analysis and statistical and performance analysis.
Finally, the bill of materials is presented in the .xlsx file.
